# Overview

This is a discord bot i created out of interest for both AI and for a project to put my recently acquired coding
skills in python to the test. Still very much work in progress, i do not have a deadline as this is not intended
for public use.

# Roadmap
- [] **AI**
  - [x] **Llama3-8B implementation**
    - [x] Implement speech recognition with STT
    - [x] Implement TTS
  - [x] **Memory**
    - [x] Give The AI short term memory to remember previous prompts
    - [x] Work on long term memory
  - [ ] **Fine Tuning** 

# About the language model

The language model is Llama 3-8B as already explained, i dont know whether or not i will eventually move to a 70B implementation
what is sure is that the next step after the basics have been planted is to begin fine tuning the model.
I dont know when that will happen since i currently do not have the resources for fine tuning.
